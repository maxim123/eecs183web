			<li>One final project proposal per team is due to the <a href="#autograder">Autograder</a> by Monday, 11/17 at 6PM (but really 11:55PM).</li>
			<li>The showcase proposal must be a PDF that follows exactly one of these naming rules:
			<ul>
				<li>Arduino_Proposal_teamname.pdf</li>
				<li>Creature_Proposal_teamname.pdf</li>
				<li>Piazza_Proposal_teamname.pdf</li>
				<li>Life_Proposal_teamname.pdf</li>
				<li>WebSched_Proposal_teamname.pdf</li>
				<li>LargeData_Proposal_teamname.pdf</li>
			</ul>
			Please replace "teamname" with your team's name. Please use the team name you received in your email.<br/>
			If your team feels very passionate about doing a different project, please submit your proposal as:
			<ul>
				<li>Other_Proposal_teamname.pdf</li>
			</ul>
			We strongly suggest you talk with a staff member before doing this.
			</li>
			<li>For guidelines regarding the content of your proposal, please see your particular project's spec. If you do not already see a section labeled "Proposal" in your spec, check back frequently. They will be up very soon.</li>
			<li>For the moment, please refrain from creating your own GitHub repository. We are working on setting up private repositories for each group and will notify teams when they are ready.</li>
